# Capstone-Project-II---Nested-Loops

Compulsory Task 1 (TriTable.py):

This is a program that makes use of nested loops to create the below number pyramid:

1
2 4
3 6 9
4 8 12 16
5 10 15 20 25
6 12 18 24 30 36
7 14 21 28 35 42 49
8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64
9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81


Compulsory Task 2 (task2.py):

This is a program that checks if a number inputted by the user is prime. It does this by first asking the user to enter a number, checks if the number is greater than 1 and if it is, checks to see if the numnber has any factors besides 1 and itself.

If the number is a prime number, a message is printed to the screen stating this fact. If the number is not a prime number, a different message is printed to the screen stating this.
