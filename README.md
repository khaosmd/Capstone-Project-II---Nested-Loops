# Nested_Loops_Project

Compulsory Task 1 (TriTable.py):

This is a program that makes use of nested loops to create a number pyramid.

Compulsory Task 2 (task2.py):

This is a program that checks if a number inputted by the user is prime. It does this by first asking the user to enter a number, checks if the number is greater than 1 and if it is, checks to see if the numnber has any factors besides 1 and itself.

If the number is a prime number, a message is printed to the screen stating this fact. If the number is not a prime number, a different message is printed to the screen stating this.
